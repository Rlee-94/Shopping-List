## Built with

## Outcome

* Used HTML5 for better readability and structure.
* Used CSS for styling.
* Utilized javascript for interactivity. 
* Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management.
* Tried to maintain **clean code**.

## Summary

### What I learned

* Gained a better understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** foundations.
* Practiced aligning and containing a webpage using **flex** 
* Utilized StackOverflow to help add click and keyboard event listeners. These event listeners allow users to click on the item and strikethrough, or they can delete the item with the delete button. Any new item that's added will also have a delete button automatically placed beside it. 
* I used [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/) and another [CSS Tricks link](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backdrop-filter/) to help apply my background image/blur.
